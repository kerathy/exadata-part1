I am unemployed now(since the end of March) and have to find another job as soon as possible. I worked for Exa Data from May 2021 to mid Oct 2021.

If the code in my github repository is used for commercial purposes, I reserve the right to pursue the financial loss caused by that.

Do not pretend to be me to get any job opportunities, no matter who you are, I will hold you accountable for the loss(including but not limited to reputational damage, financial loss) caused by your impersonation. I am single.
