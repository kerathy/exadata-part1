For all the projects I listed on my resume, all of them are finished by me, my project partner, my professor independently. If they are used on imappropriate purpose(university application, job application, commercial purpose), no matter who you are, I will pursue all losses.

I am unemployed now(since the end of March) and have to find another job as soon as possible. I worked for Exa Data from May 2021 to mid Oct 2021.

If the code in my github repository is used for inappropriate purposes, I reserve the right to pursue the losses caused by that.

Do not pretend to be me to get any job opportunities, no matter who you are, I will pursue the loss caused by your impersonation(including but not limited to reputation damage, economic loss). I am single.
