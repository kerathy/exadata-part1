https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_NaJneoA0KdtLOxSNkWRyoAmAjEwbZMQ/view?usp=sharing

I am not bound to any companies. Any job opportunities are welcome.

I don't conduct interviews on behalf of anyone. My voice is easy to recognize. If it involves corruption, that's not I can control.

I made the statement on May 7th, 2022(It should be earlier(maybe github can show the time), I forget that, that should be earlier than I uploaded the audio.), sometimes I updated something, and the last updated date is Jun 14th, 2022. I uploaded the audio on May 7th, 2022.

### Please do not affect my life, my career(no limitation!!! I like step by step), no matter who you are, I do not have any problems. I am not responsible for other's life.
### Affect other's life, career(Tab - selfish people). None of my business!!! No matter what kind of decision you made, no one forces you to make that decision, it is up to you.


### For all the projects I listed on my resume, all of them are finished by me, my project partner, my professor independently, no one else helps us. If they are used for any inappropriate purposes(university application, job application, commercial purpose), no matter who you are, I will pursue all the losses.

If anyone pretends to be me or my friend to obtain any icbc's information through illegal channel, disclose anything that should not be disclosed, I am not responsible for that, no matter who you are, you should be responsible for your own behavior. I am not responsible for other's life, none of my business, no solution can be provided! I did not snitch on anyone, nor did I cooperate with others to snitch on anyone. I did not report anyone before. My family and I did not disclose anything about icbc(including but not limited to clinets' cases, internal stuffs) to anyone. I never discussed my job with anyone(including but not limited to family, friends, professors, etc). I wrote a little about icbc during the master of professional accounting, however, that is not important and not confidential. I did not start my dissertation, and I never disclosed anything that should not be disclosed. My friends never discussed their jobs with me after resignation. Do not influence my and my family members' career. 


I am unemployed now(since the end of March, that means I do not have any job now, no matter is paid or unpaid, I did not take any university's courses after Apr, 2020) and have to find another job as soon as possible. Do not waste my time and affect my career. I promise if I am involved in any illegal activity, even though I am in the United States, I will cooperate with any investigation. If you think any inappropriate words are used on my LinkedIn profile, please feel free to contact me. This is my LinkedIn profile. https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaoyanxu123/ I worked for Exa Data from May 2021 to mid Oct 2021(Sita Health Apr 2021 only). After that, my job is not related to engineering. Now, I am looking for a job which is related to a programmer, software engineer. If the code in my github repository is used for any inappropriate purposes(Sometimes I wrote codes overnight and weekends(ExaData and SitaHealth), the codes in my github repository(ExaData and SitaHealth) are completed by me alone), I reserve the right to pursue all the losses caused by that.


Do not pretend to be me to get any interview opportunities or other purposes, that will influence my credit. For Exa Data, I just had one interview(Ford, I almost ac the coding questions.) before, I showed my passport during the interview, I did not wear face mask, I did not get the job offer(xiaoyanxu77@gmail.com is the gmail account they created for marketing purposes(this is they mentioned) to help me look for a job when I worked for them(we did not use for other purposes), I am not sure whether it is used for other purposes or not, multiple people can access to that account). For Sita Health, I did not have any interviews when I worked for them. If anyone impersonating me to get the interview opportunites when they worked for them. That is not me. I will write an ICC case analysis later when I am free if someone tries to utilize my U Visa application to do some unethical things or achieve something they do not deserve.
 



Do not pretend to be me to get any opportunities(including but not limited to job opportunities). In case someone impersonating me using that gmail account xuxiaoyan152@gmail.com(the previous one, when I joined the marketing program) and xiaoyanxu726@gmail.com(the current one, after one month of the marketing program)(A company - SynergisticIT is helping me find a job(I signed the marketing program on Apr 14th, which can not stop my unemployment days. The last day of allowed unemployment is June 4th. I have already applied for U Visa, however, that can not stop my unemployment days,  and I am waiting for the receipt notice. I do not have any income now. I have to find another job as soon as possible, so if there is any urgent opennings, please feel free to contact me directly xu05172022@gmail.com. I have to maintain my work authorization status in the United States.), that gmail account is the company created for me, I can not access to that account. That means I can not see what kind of things they replied to the recruiter. So I am not responsible for their behaviors.) to get interview opportunities. I will list all the interview opportunities I got here through their companies(if necessary, I will tell the company name later). (I just had a few hr calls（I will list all the hr calls here later）, two interviews until now, if someone else impersonatinng me is interviewing, that is not me)

1. chuwaamerica - May 10th 1:00 pm pst   2. New York Life - May 24th 10:00 am pst - financial related position 3. NTT Data - July 8th, 12:00 am pst(The original interview appointment is at 11:30 a.m. PST; the actual interview is delayed by 30 minutes. Meeting ID: 706 768 8543)

if there are multilple interviews, I will put a google link here.

If anyone has any doubts about the accounts icc use before(I can not log in xxyxuxiaoyan152@gmail.com and xiaoyanxu726@gmail.com these two accounts. Multiple people could log in to this account, xiaoyanxu77@gmail.com), or if anyone received any weird emails from these account, not me! Highly recommend to check that account creation time, the ip address and who used these accounts during that period(I mean the time you received the email, that should tell the answer.)


In case someone pretends to be me for interview opportunities or other purposes, you can let them show their passports during the interview session. I can show my passport in the interview, onsite and share my screen to show my gmail account xxyxuxiaoyan6@gmail.com for identification. This gmail account xuxiaoyan152@gmail.com(the is the first one, they created it when I joined the marketing program, that is they mentioned) and xiaoyanxu726@gmail.com(the current one, they created it after one month of the marketing program, that is they mentioned) are SynergisticIT created for marketing purposes(I can not log in to that account!!! If that is used for multiple clients, other purposes, that is without my permission, no matter who you are. The company mentioned that was just created for me for marketing purposes. If someone discovers that kind of situation or these two accounts are used for other purposes, please let me know. I can contact the company in case we have any misunderstanding. For each client, they should have their own gmail account.), I can not log in to that account. I am not responsible for the email they replied to, they sent. For some important confirmation, please send an email to xu05172022@gmail.com. I have to use my own resume to get the job, do not impersonate me and use my resume, I have to apply for formal full-time opportunities at the same time, not just contractors' opportunities, do not affect my career. If anyone slandered me(Maybe they have other unknown purposes, maybe cover their own inapproprate or illegal issues, I do not want to guess anything, because that is irresponsible. if it is me, I will not do that, because I do not have any problems. 

If you have money, you can change the rule, hopefully that will not happen in the United States. Sometimes politics is more horrible, that is an invisible hand, no matter how you do, truth will never be discovered. I do not like disgusting stuff. If you believe someone's slander against me just because of their better education background, I sympathize for that, I also sympathize for the univesity they attended before. In my opinion, that is an unqualified university, if that slander happened, beware of all of them. I do not have any inappropriate behavior, no matter in life or in my job. I have already made a statement here, if someone got hired by a company using my resume, that is the company's credit problem, who hired that person should also be responsible for that. Maybe they conspired together, beware of all of them(lack of credit) if they quitted their job and found new opportunities. If that involves bribery, a lawsuit can be filed for that, even though you do not have work authorization problem, even though you have better education background, I do not think you derserve that. Sometimes people can not receive better education, just because they do not have enough funds, better education background can not represent anything. Ethical problems and capability are the most important things, if you can not meet the requirements, it is time for you to look for a new job. If you receive better education because of bribery, you get a good job because of your better education background, Or because you want your higher tuition back, you do inappropriate behavior(such as bribery) when you hire a people, Or you get a good job because of bribery, and your child can accept better education because of your salary, don't you think it is wierd? I do not want to use other peolple's resume, no matter who you are, how could you know whether they are involved in illegal behaviours(suh as bribery) or not. After you change your nationality, use other people’s resume to avoid their bribery behaviors be discovered, and get higher salary, and let more and more people(if they do not know before) involve in this kind of stuff(help with bribery indirectly), don’t you think it’s weirder? 

That is another reason I did not allow anyone to use my resume. If that really happened(use other people's resume to get a job/university offer and affect other's career), no solution can be provided. The only solution is to admit your mistake, no matter who you are, do not affect my career, do not affect other people’s career. I am not responsible for other’s life, no matter who you are, everyone should be responsible for their own behavior, their own decision. Do you know why that kind of stuff happens, because they have to maintain a university’s reputation, don’t you think it is ridiculous? Once a student is admitted by a good university, no matter what kind of mistakes they make, They do not have to be responsible for that, because their university will cover up all the truth for them. They will sacrifice other’s career, if that is not discovered. Just because the ridiculous university have to maintain their ridiculous reputation, at the expense of others’ future. If that kind of stuff happens, I think what that university advocate is that when you get a job, please keep bribing, so you can have more money, you can donate to the university, to guarantee your child can be admitted by a good university again. Sometimes, universities will union together, because of politics, or some other benefits, to cover the truth, or to maintain the most ridiculous university’s reputation. Eventually, more and more universities become ridiculous. Money talks. Don’t you think it is a ridiculous society? What’s the origin? Money, benefit or the ridiculous university's reputation?


I am not authorized to access to that gmail account(even though I requested multiple times), they mentioned they had their own resources, the opportunities came from their channels would be sent to xuxiaoyan152@gmail.com(the first one, when I joined the marketing program) and xiaoyanxu726@gmail.com(the current one, after one month of the marketing program). I have to find another job as soon as possible, so I create a new account today, xu05172022@gmail.com, for any job opportunities, email can be sent to this account, attached is my resume, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1peQ2ImqMTU1R6-V4k0WZVey-4oYK5jzjgpwSN29J94g/edit?usp=sharing I will let my company know later, to protect our both career, do not worry about that.

For job opportunities, you can email me(xu05172022@gmail.com), the company I signed the contract with(if anyone using my resume is working or gets a job offer, that will influence me to get a job offer. Please contact me directly. Do not be selfish, you can use your own resume to get the job. No matter who you are, you do not have the right to affect my carrer. That is the basic ethical issue. It is impossible for two peolpe using the same resume to get the job offer, that will influence my credit. Use your own, what you are doing now represents the education you received before. If you do not know how to deal with that kind of situtaion, that is the responsibility of your university you attened bfore. That is the basic moral questions, that is also your proferssors' responsibilities, if you are not educated well. Before learninng knowledge, you should learn how to be a human being. If that kind of situation happens(Use other people's resume to get a job/university offer and affect other's career), I am curious why you were accepted by your university you attended before. Or we can say that you do not deserve that degree, your university you attended before can not meet the qualification to be a university. If that kind of situation happens involving bribery, if you got the job or university offer, that is that company/university's credit problem. Also that is your parents' problem to teach you to be a human being.). I never recommended anyone to join the indian consulting companies, I am not responsible for that.


Do not pretend to be me to get any opportunities(including but not limited to job opportunities), I do not have an English name, no matter who you are, I will pursue the losses caused by your impersonation(including but not limited to reputation damage, economic loss). I am single(no ex-boyfriend, no kids, I have siblings, nephew and niece). Please do not pretend to be my ex or someone I dated before(I do not have ex or any date, 
I had blind dates before(there is a forum used for blind dates in China), but that is someone I am not familiar with. I never met with them offline. I never met with them online alone(no video call, no zoom meeting, etc). I just attended some of the lectures they organized before. They never met with me online(no video call, no zoom meeting, etc). I do not care that kind of things. I never intervened in someone else's relationship, because if someone has a girlfriend, they will not pose their post on that forum, except for some other purpose)(if you think someone is, that is their conspiracy, in order to cover up something, obtain something they do not deserve. I did not involve in their conspiracy, sometimes, when their conspiracy is discovered, in order to cover up that conspiracy, they will try to let more and more people be involved in their conspiracy, even sacrifice other's career, they do not care. Because if more and more people are involved in that conspiracy, it will become more and more difficult to be solved. Very terrible. If it is me, I will stay away from them, you will never know when the next conspiracy happens again, you will never know when your career is ruined by them.) or friend for any purpose, none of my business. I have never intervened in other people's relationships as a third party, please don't use this as an excuse to gain anything you do not deserve. I have not engaged in any illegal conduct(including but not limited to corruption, bribery, unethical or immoral behaviour), nor have I engaged in any unethical conduct. My family has not received any illegal benefits because of my job, and I did not disclose anything to them, and they did not benefit from me because of the informaton I provided. And they did not receive any illegal benefits(I know what it is legal, what it is illegal, what it is risky, what it is not risky, if anyone has any concerns about my family, please feel free to contact me. If you do not know, or you do not have enough knowledge and experience to evaluate something, please ask your professor or experienced person. If you do not know the definition of some terminology, please google it. Thanks! Firstly, I am financially independent. Secondly, I do not think anyone has the right to investigate my family if we did not involve in illegal activities. If just because someone has doubts with my family, so you say some irresponsible words. So that means if I have doubts with you, you(including your family) can be investigated too, even though you did not involve in any illegal activities. Does that sound funny? What’s more, I highly suggest that if someone has any doubts, please do some research on China’s accounting policies, China’s microeconomics and macroeconomics. Then you will know what is going on.). 


I did not sign any non-competition clause, and I was not involved in any dangerous and confidential things in my previous job, that means I do not have any limitation in my career, no matter in China or in the United States. If anyone has any concerns, feel free to contact me. Education(including but not limited to studying abroad) is at our own expense. The master's degree I dropped out in China, just because I got another university's offer in the United States, I wanted to work in the United States, no other reason. I can provide all the formal contracts, offer letters and resignation letters. For all the jobs I did before, I resigned them(If any evidence needed, please let me know. I sent icbc emails before, no one replied to me, when I resigned my job, I did not have any problems. After resignation, no other employees contacted me later. Except for an employee from the HR department contacted me later, there was a supplemented document of resignation which needed to be mailed back, you just needed to sign and mailed it back(A signature of blank content), they did not mention anything else.I think I should not have any problems. For the job in China, email can be sent to get their formal confirmation, HR@us.icbc.com.cn). If anyone impersonates me, to prove the job experience in China, you can ask them to provide formal paper contracts(One position should correspond to one formal paper contract. What's more, You can ask them to provide their identifcation card(Even though they change their nationality, a certificate issued by China's notary office can be requested), payroll record and provident fund record), to prove the job experience in the United States, you can ask them to provide offer letters. ICBC has my fingerprint record, if necessary(if someone impersonates me), we can do fingerprint recognition. If someone gets hired using my resume, hr should be responsible for that. None of my business.



I guarantee that I have not disclosed anything that should not have been disclosed(including but not limited to client cases, internal situations) to anyone. But I do not exclude the possibility that someone obtains information through illegal channels, and in order to impersonate me, disclose information that should not be disclosed. Especially the working experience in China, my previous employer has the right to pursue corporate's reputation damage because of your impersonation no matter who you are. I did not allow anyone(including but not limited to friends, classmates, professors, any companies) using my resume to impersonate me for any university application or job applciation(If someone used my resume, that is a liar. They should be responsible for their own behavior. Please do not be selfish(Do not get what you do not deserve at the expense of other people's credibility). Please do not affect my career, my work authorization and my credit in the United States. I never agree with anyone impersonating me, no matter who you are, that will influence my credit. Also, that is illegal. If any lawsuit is filed for that because of corporate's reputation damage, I will cooperate with any investigation, please feel free to contact me. 

Some recruiters receive the pdf of my passport, visa, EAD and master's degree certificate before(I took a course before, they have the pdf of my identification card), but they do not have the original ones, you can let them show the original ones. However, sometimes all of them can be faked. If anyone discovers somone impersonating me, please let me know, I will take legal action. This is my previous leetcode account: plmoknijb(I have changed the username on Jul 27th.). I did not record any video solving leetcode questions using my account before(but I have interviews before using my account to solve leetcode questions).
Also I did some contractors' assignments(NYC Green Taxi Dataset) before while applying for some contractors' positions. If any of them are used for impersonation, I will take legal action. All my experiences(no matter is paid or unpaid) have already listed on my LinkedIn profile, as far as I know, there should be no one abroad who has had the similar experience with me. So if hr receives a similar resume, it is likely to be a fake resume, strongly recommend to verify it. If any assistance is needed, feel free to contact me. No matter what you do, where you are, if that is a fake one, that will be discovered eventually. But if ICBC allows that kind of behaviour, that will never be discovered. I no longer work for them, it is up to them. Do not use mine, use others', if ICBC allows that kind of behaviour. I am not responsile for ICBC's behaviour, I have to guarantee my profile does not have any problems, do not influence my credit. I have a long way to go in the United States, even the world. If they allow that kind of behaviour, you can add any experience on your resume, that will not cause any problems. If my later visa has any problems because of ICBC's irresponsible behaviour, I think USCIS will deal with that kind of situation, that’s the politics problem, that is not the problem I can solve. As long as it does not influence my life, my family, my credit, my career path and my visa, I do not care how ICBC solves that kind of problems if it was allowed before, that is not my responsibility. I do not plan to go back to China, I want to have my career in the United States. No limitation, no matter is full-time or contractors. If someone impersonating me, and it was allowed by ICBC before. ICBC should be responsible for solving that problem, that is the basic enterprise’s responsibility and their credit problem, none of my business. No matter who you are, everyone is equal in the United States. If that really happens and affects my career, if ICBC can not solve that, at least China should be responsible for solving that, not at the expense of my career. If that is accepted by China’s official(They will never do fingerprint recognition, if that is accepted by China’s official, just a piece of cake. Because that will cause a lot of time and money, that is unnecessary for them to correct a mistake. Sometimes they do not even know that is a mistake.), it is possible for two people using the same resume to get the job, even in the same company, same position, same location. Do not worry about that. No risk! There is no need to do extra stuff. They do not care about this kind of trifle. If use mine before, just delete that or replace others' or modify the resume they used before if they use mine(If they pretend to use a fake one to get a job, that means they do not care their career, that means no matter what kind of resume, it does not matter, modify their resume in the hr system, replace the similar one, money can achieve that, or the company who hire them before should be responsible for correcting that mistake.). No risk（Companies' HR systems are similar.). Or just ignore it(If someone is not responsible for their life, life will tell you how to be responsible for yourself later.). Unless they still want to achieve other stuffs. I am not responsible for others’ life. Do not try to modify my career path because someone else used my resume before. I have a long way to go in the United States. If someone impersonates me before, obtains information through illegal channel and discloses anything that should not be disclosed, in order to maintain their reputation, that is the only reason they will sacrifice my career, pure speculation, they need a scapegoat. Now I have already clarified all my working experience on my LinkedIn, so that will not influence me. They will find another scapegoat. Get everything back on track, I have to look for full-time jobs at the same time. If anyone used my resume before(I never allow anyone to use mine, no matter who you are), please send an email to icbc to explain what you’ve done before(no matter where you are), tell your company’s hr directly and maybe negotiate whether you should return your salary back or not. Or the company who hired that employee, please send an email to icbc to explain the situation. Please do not influence me. If a company(or an individual) uses my resume for some purposes, I am not sure whether this company will be investigated or not in the future. If someone receives something you do not deserve, return it back. One generation destroys three generations. The only reason they dare not use their resume is bribery or at least violate China’s bottom line, just speculation. Do not use mine. I do not want to be investigated because of someone else’s bribery. I never involved in this kind of stuff(help with bribery indirectly).


### The projects below are what I did during my master's degree. What's more, I have another natural language processing project. Because some recruiters and someone else received my resume before, so if anyone(except for my university's class project partner) uses them for job application or other purposes, please let me know. I do not allow anyone to use my projects. No matter who you are, I will pursue all the losses caused by your impersonation. 


If anyone finds that kind of situation, you can tell the hr directly, to maintain a fair competitive environment in the United States. I have to guarantee my resume which will not be rejected because someone else uses my projects. If any evidence is needed, please feel free to contact me(LinkedIn). The hiring committee has the right to retract any job offer, any university offer.

A Chinese proverb: 君子坦荡荡，小人长戚戚
