### For all the projects I listed on my resume, all of them are finished by me, my project partner, my professor independently, no one else helps us. If they are used on inappropriate purpose(university application, job application, commercial purpose), no matter who you are, I will pursue all the losses.

I am unemployed now(since the end of March) and have to find another job as soon as possible. I worked for Exa Data from May 2021 to mid Oct 2021. After that, my job is not related to engineering. Now, I am looking for a job which is related to programmer, software engineer.
If the code in my github repository is used for inappropriate purposes, I reserve the right to pursue the losses caused by that.

Do not pretend to be me to get any opportunities(including but not limited to job opportunities), no matter who you are, I will pursue the losses caused by your impersonation(including but not limited to reputation damage, economic loss). I am single.




### The projects below are what I did during my master's degree. What's more, I have another natural language processing project. Because some recruiters received my resume before, so if anyone(except for my university's class project partner) uses them for job application or other purposes, please let me know. I do not allow anyone to use my projects. No matter who you are, I will pursue all the losses caused by your impersonation.
