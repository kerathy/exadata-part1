### For all the projects I listed on my resume, all of them are finished by me, my project partner, my professor independently, no one else helps us. If they are used for any inappropriate purpose(university application, job application, commercial purpose), no matter who you are, I will pursue all the losses.


I am unemployed now(since the end of March) and have to find another job as soon as possible. I promise if I am involved in any illegal activity, even though I am in the United States, I will cooperate with any investigation. If you think any inappropriate words are used on my LinkedIn profile, please feel free to contact me. This is my LinkedIn profile. https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaoyanxu123/ I worked for Exa Data from May 2021 to mid Oct 2021(Sita Health Apr 2021 only). After that, my job is not related to engineering. Now, I am looking for a job which is related to programmer, software engineer. If the code in my github repository is used for any inappropriate purpose, I reserve the right to pursue the losses caused by that.



Do not pretend to be me to get any opportunities(including but not limited to job opportunities), no matter who you are, I will pursue the losses caused by your impersonation(including but not limited to reputation damage, economic loss). I am single(no ex-boyfriend). I have not engaged in any illegal conduct(including but not limited to corruption, bribery), nor have I engaged in any unethical conduct. My family has not received any illegal benefits because of my job. I did not sign any non-competition clause. Education(including but not limited to studying abroad) is at our own expense.


### The projects below are what I did during my master's degree. What's more, I have another natural language processing project. Because some recruiters and someone else received my resume before, so if anyone(except for my university's class project partner) uses them for job application or other purposes, please let me know. I do not allow anyone to use my projects. No matter who you are, I will pursue all the losses caused by your impersonation. 

If anyone finds that kind of situation, you can tell the hr directly, to maintain a fair competitive environment in the United States. I have to guarantee my resume which will not be rejected because someone else uses my project. If any evidence is needed, please feel free to contact me(LinkedIn). The hiring committee has the right to retract any job offer, any university offer.
