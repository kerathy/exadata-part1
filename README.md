### For all the projects I listed on my resume, all of them are finished by me, my project partner, my professor independently, no one else helps us. If they are used for any inappropriate purposes(university application, job application, commercial purpose), no matter who you are, I will pursue all the losses.

I am unemployed now(since the end of March) and have to find another job as soon as possible. Do not waste my time and affect my career. I promise if I am involved in any illegal activity, even though I am in the United States, I will cooperate with any investigation. If you think any inappropriate words are used on my LinkedIn profile, please feel free to contact me. This is my LinkedIn profile. https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaoyanxu123/ I worked for Exa Data from May 2021 to mid Oct 2021(Sita Health Apr 2021 only). After that, my job is not related to engineering. Now, I am looking for a job which is related to a programmer, software engineer. If the code in my github repository is used for any inappropriate purposes(Sometimes I worked overnight and weekends, the codes in my github repository(ExaData and SitaHealth) are completed by me alone), I reserve the right to pursue all the losses caused by that.


Do not pretend to be me to get any opportunities(including but not limited to job opportunities)(I do not get too many interview opportunites. In case someone pretends to be me for interview opportunities, you can let them show their passports during the interview session. I can show my passport in the interview, onsite and share my screen to show my gmail account xxyxuxiaoyan6@gmail.com for identification. This gmail account xuxiaoyan152@gmail.com is a company created for me(If that is used for multiple clients, that is without my permission, no matter who you are. If someone discovers that kind of situation, please let me know. I can contact the company in case we have any misunderstanding. For each client, they should have their own gmail account.), I can not log in to that account. I am not responsible for the email content they reply. For some important confirmation, please send an email to xxyxuxiaoyan6@gmail.com. For job opportunites, you can email me and the company(that can not stop my unemployment days) who is helping me find a job at the same time, to protect our both career.


Do not pretend to be me to get any opportunities(including but not limited to job opportunities), I do not have an English name, no matter who you are, I will pursue the losses caused by your impersonation(including but not limited to reputation damage, economic loss). I am single(no ex-boyfriend, no kids, I have siblings). Please do not pretend to be my ex or friend for any purpose(obtain something you do not deserve), none of my business. I have not engaged in any illegal conduct(including but not limited to corruption, bribery), nor have I engaged in any unethical conduct. My family has not received any illegal benefits because of my job. I did not sign any non-competition clause. Education(including but not limited to studying abroad) is at our own expense. I can provide all the formal contracts, offer letters and resignation letters. For all the jobs I did before, I resigned them(If any evidence needed, please let me know. I sent them emails before, no one replied to me, I think I should not have any problems. For the job in China, email can be sent to get their formal confirmation, HR@us.icbc.com.cn). If anyone impersonates me, to prove the job experience in China, you can ask them to provide formal paper contracts(One position should correspond to one formal paper contract. What's more, You can ask them to provide their identifcation card(Even though they change their nationality, a certificate issued by China's notary office can be requested), payroll record and provident fund record), to prove the job experience in the United States, you can ask them to provide offer letters. ICBC has my fingerprint record, if necessary(if someone impersonates me), we can do fingerprint recognition. If someone gets hired using my resume, hr should be responsible for that.



I guarantee that I have not disclosed anything that should not have been disclosed(including but not limited to client cases, internal situations) to anyone. But I do not exclude the possibility that someone obtains information through illegal channels, and in order to impersonate me, disclose information that should not be disclosed. Especially the working experience in China, my previous employer has the right to pursue corporate's reputation damage because of your impersonation no matter who you are. I did not allow anyone(including but not limited to friends, classmates, professors, any companies) using my resume to impersonate me for any university application or job applciation(If someone used my resume, that is a liar. They should be responsible for their own behavior. Please do not be selfish(Do not get what you do not deserve at the expense of other people's credibility). Please do not affect my career, my work authorization and my credit in the United States. I never agree with anyone impersonating me, no matter who you are, that will influence my credit. Also, that is illegal. If any lawsuit is filed for that because of corporate's reputation damage, I will cooperate with any investigation, please feel free to contact me. 


Some recruiters receive the pdf of my passport, visa, EAD and master's degree certificate before(I took a course before, they have the pdf of my identification card), but they do not have the original ones, you can let them show the original ones. If anyone discovers somone impersonating me, please let me know, I will take legal action. This is my leetcode account: plmoknijb. I did not record any video solving leetcode questions using my account before(but I have interviews before using my account to solve leetcode questions).
Also I did some contractors' assignment before while applying for some contractors' position. If any of them are used for impersonation, I will take legal action. All my experiences have already listed on my LinkedIn profile, as far as I know, there should be no one abroad who has had the similar experience with me. So if hr receives a similar resume, it is likely to be a fake resume, strongly recommend to verify it. If any assistance is needed, feel free to contact me. No matter what you do, where you are, if that is a fake one, that will be discovered eventually.


### The projects below are what I did during my master's degree. What's more, I have another natural language processing project. Because some recruiters and someone else received my resume before, so if anyone(except for my university's class project partner) uses them for job application or other purposes, please let me know. I do not allow anyone to use my projects. No matter who you are, I will pursue all the losses caused by your impersonation. 


If anyone finds that kind of situation, you can tell the hr directly, to maintain a fair competitive environment in the United States. I have to guarantee my resume which will not be rejected because someone else uses my projects. If any evidence is needed, please feel free to contact me(LinkedIn). The hiring committee has the right to retract any job offer, any university offer.
